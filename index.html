<div class="post-content">
  <p>
    being non-binary is not new. This rhetoric of new &#39gender ideology&#39 taking over is white fragility. these are racist narratives that deliberately conceal the lived reality of gender variant BiPoC.
    </p>
    <p>
the real &#39gender ideology&#39 &#39erasing how things used to be&#39 is the binary gender/sex system which was forcibly imposed on the entire world through the criminalization + murder of gender variant people. what&#39s new is the masquerading of this cultural racism with the rhetoric of biology.

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Imagine feeling like a walking joke every time you walk down the street.

Imagine questioning your own identity time and time again because it&#39s common to think one&#39s gender is valid as long as it stands on one of the two extremes of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_binary">binary</a>.

Imagine being punished for no longer being able to fit in the box they say you belong in and for refusing to do so because living your life by other people&#39s standards is not your duty.

Imagine understanding that when people make too much emphasis on the type of chromosomes you have they&#39re trying to tell you that you should act accordingly and <em>stop pretending</em>.

Imagine being told you&#39re making your life more difficult and that you should <em><strong>tone it down a little</strong></em> to make the ones around you more comfortable, otherwise it&#39ll be your fault if anyone reacts disrespectfully.

Imagine denying yourself to be who you are simply because you don&#39t have the energy or strength to face those who don&#39t condone your existence and those who have the audacity to act against it.
</p>
<p>
  I guess policing each other&#39s gender identity is more fun than respecting and acknowledging the people you COEXIST with and minding your own business.

Either way, SHUT THE FUCK UP with your hate speeches and let ALL OF US be.
